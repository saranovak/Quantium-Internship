## Introduction

This project aims to provide a strategic recommendation to Julia, the Category Manager, supported by data analysis. To achieve this goal, we need to analyze the data to understand the current purchasing trends and behaviors, as well as evaluate the performance of a store trial conducted in stores 77, 86, and 88.

We will be using the R language to complete this analysis, and our tasks will involve high-level data checks, creating summaries of the data, finding outliers, correcting data formats, deriving extra features such as pack size and brand name, and defining metrics of interest to enable us to draw insights on who spends on chips and what drives spends for each customer segment.

For the performance evaluation of the store trial, we will consider the monthly sales experience of each store, broken down by total sales revenue, total number of customers, and average number of transactions per customer. We will create a measure to compare different control stores to each of the trial stores and test if total sales are significantly different in the trial period and if so, check if the driver of change is more purchasing customers or more purchases per customers.

## Tasks

1. Analyze the data to understand the current purchasing trends and behaviors
2. Evaluate the performance of a store trial conducted in stores 77, 86, and 88
3. Create a measure to compare different control stores to each of the trial stores
4. Test if total sales are significantly different in the trial period and if so, check if the driver of change is more purchasing customers or more purchases per customers.

## Data

The data for this analysis will be provided in a csv file format. We will be using the QVI_data dataset for the store trial evaluation and customer segmentation analysis. The dataset contains the following variables:

LYLTY_CARD_NBR: customer card number
DATE: date of transaction
STORE_NBR: store number
TXN_ID: transaction ID
PROD_NBR: product number
PROD_NAME: product name
PROD_QTY: quantity of product purchased
TOT_SALES: total sales value of transaction

## Analysis

The analysis will be carried out using R language, and we will be performing the following tasks:

1. Data cleaning and preparation:

*Loading the dataset

*Checking for missing values

*Checking for outliers

*Correcting data formats

*Deriving extra features such as pack size and brand name


2.Customer segmentation analysis:

*Defining metrics of interest to enable us to draw insights on who spends on chips and what drives spends for each customer segment

*Analyzing customer behavior and spending trends

3.Store trial performance evaluation:

*Creating a measure to compare different control stores to each of the trial stores

*Testing if total sales are significantly different in the trial period

*Checking if the driver of change is more purchasing customers or more purchases per customers


## Results

The results of the analysis will provide insights on customer behavior and spending trends, as well as the performance of the store trial. We will be able to identify customer segments and their purchasing behaviors and draw insights on what drives customer spending for each segment. We will also be able to compare different control stores to each of the trial stores and test if total sales are significantly different in the trial period and what factors drive any observed changes.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of purchasing
